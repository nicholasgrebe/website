I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the [Department of Evolutionary Anthropology at Duke University](https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/), and member of the [Drea Lab](http://drealab.weebly.com). My research interests focus on the evolution of social and mating behavior, with a particular emphasis on hormonal mechanisms. I'm a big believer in the value of interdisciplinary perspectives--my work combines methods from social psychology, comparative neuroscience, ethology, and evolutionary biology. Currently, I'm working on an NSF-funded project that investigates the role of oxytocin in the evolution of lemur social behavior.
