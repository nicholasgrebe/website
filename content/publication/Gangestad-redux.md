Jünger et al. (2018) conducted a preregistered study examining whether women particularly prefer
muscular bodies when conceptive in their cycles. Despite an impressive number of participants and
within-woman observations, they found no evidence for a preference shift; rather, they claimed,
conceptive women find all male bodies more attractive. We preregistered a separate study very similar
to Jünger et al.’s, with specified analyses focusing on shifts associated with joint additive effects of log-transformed estradiol and progesterone (ln(E/P)). We performed similar analyses on Jünger et al.’s
publicly available data, using an empirically vetted (though not preregistered) measure of
Strength/Muscularity. They revealed a ln(E/P) × Strength/Muscularity × Relationship Status
interaction effect on sexual attraction. The ln(E/P) × Strength/Muscularity interaction ran in opposite
directions for partnered and single women effects largely driven by P levels. Jünger et al.’s null
conclusions and claims about general preferences are premature. We offer several observations
regarding preregistered analyses.
